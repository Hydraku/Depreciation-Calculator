# Depreciation-Calculator
My freshmen project in c++ that calculates depreciation. 
Note: There are still some few bugs in this code.
Moreover, this was run in vscode. So, you need to configure your setting to compile and run this code.

The sourcecode.docx is the documentation for the presentation of my code. 
Honestly, I kinda manipulated some oputput there and forgot what I manipulated. Only for the reading, not the code itself because there are some bugs I couldn't find.
Maybe, in the future I will fix this dep calc for good sharing in the internet.
